Included.  Scalable File Upload? Of course! This is a must-take course if you work with Node.Node Internals: Here's one of the most common interview questions you'll face when looking for a Node job: 'Can you explain Node's Event Loop?'

Besides being critical for interviews, knowledge of the Event Loop will give you a better understanding of how Node works internally.  Many engineers know not to 'block' the Event Loop, but they don't necessarily understand why.  You will be one of the engineers who can clearly articulate the performance profile of Node and its Event Loop."
